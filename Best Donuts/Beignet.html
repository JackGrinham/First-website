    <h1>Beignet</h1>
    <p>Another regional delicacy that’s obscure enough to warrant visible question marks above some people’s heads and quotidian enough to be 
        found at many a café and bakery—if you’re lucky enough to live in New Orleans, that is. As part of the city’s melting pot of culinary delights, 
        this gift descended from the French and French Acadians (i.e. Cajuns), despite being unrecognizable to French tourists.

        The beignet (pronounced ben-yay) is light and airy, a veritable micro-pillow of peanut-oil-fried dough that somehow bears the weight of a massive amount
         of powdered sugar sprinkled (shoveled?) over it. It’s no coincidence that it’s the best way to fend off Bourbon Street hangovers, and it dunks smashingly
          in a cup of café au lait.</p>
