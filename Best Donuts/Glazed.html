    <h1>GLazed Yeast Round</h1>
    <p>In a perfect world, the plain cake doughnut would be the standard-bearer of these hole-y confections, 
        
        but whereas the beauty of the plain cake lies in its ability to complement a cup of coffee by being dunked in it, 
        the glazed doughnut is essentially the vanilla ice cream of every corner bakery. And like vanilla ice cream, itâ€™s the best-selling variety. 
        Whether you deem the vanilla glazed doughnut boring or perfect in its simplicity, the people have spoken.</p>
