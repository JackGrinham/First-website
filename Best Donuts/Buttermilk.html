    <h1>Buttermilk Bar</h1>
    <p>This may seem like a dark horse to make this list, let alone make the podium, especially since there are pockets of this country that don’t even offer them.
         But a buttermilk bar is the augmented version of an old fashioned. It’s ameliorated both by the use of buttermilk in the cake batter in lieu of regular milk
          (there’s a reason pancakes are made with buttermilk!) and by its brick shape instead of a craggy ring. When your doughnut is this good, you want more of it.

        Pro tip: Nuke it for 20 seconds and serve with coffee or hot cocoa.
        
        Second pro tip: If the shop offers buttermilk bars in blueberry or banana, get both.
        
        Final pro tip: Do not fall for maple glazed buttermilk bars, as the maple sweetness oddly doesn’t gibe well with the overall sweetness of the cake.</p>
