    <h1>Apple Cider Donut</h1>
    <p>Beyond the allure of sweet baking spices like cinnamon and nutmeg intermingling with the distinct tang of apple cider, 
        this autumnal snack is one of the few varieties you’re expected to eat in multiples. 
        Plus there’s just something so rustic and charming about the idea of a bunch of doughnuts that are more frequently made at
         an apple orchard or cider mill than a traditional shop. This small cake doughnut comes fried or baked and deserves to make 
         fall foliage Vermont’s second most popular attraction.
