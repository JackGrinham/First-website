    <h1>Apple Fritter</h1>
    <p>Wanna know why the apple fritter is the best doughnut there is? Ask doughnut makers which singular doughnut best represents 
        their shop and they’re more than likely to point to the tray of fritters. It’s the feather in any self-respecting doughnut maker’s cap.
         Whereas virtually any doughnut will elicit some measure of excitement in the customer, extend to them an apple fritter and their pupils widen
          to the size of the craggy, chunky doughnut itself. Often prepared double the size of other doughnuts, the fritter enables those with a sweet tooth 
          the gluttonous dismissal of having eaten “just one” doughnut.</p>
