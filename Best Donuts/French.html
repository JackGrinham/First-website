    <h1>French Crulla</h1>
    <p>It’s become conventional for cosmopolitan doughnutiers to gild their lilies with photogenic toppings like candied lilacs or brûléed marshmallows, 
        but the cruller is made ornate by the body itself. A spiral appearance, a soufflé-like texture.
         It’s the only type of doughnut featured at famed New York restaurateur Danny Meyer’s Daily Provisions, 
         where it’s adorned in either cinnamon sugar, maple icing, or a flavor du jour. The cruller is common enough for cops, pretty enough for pinky-ups.</p>
