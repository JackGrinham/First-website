    <h1>Boston Cream</h1>
    <p>Given that a Boston Cream “Pie” is actually a cake, kudos to doughnut makers for stealing it back to turn it into a doughnut. 
        And kudos to Bostonians for sharing this doughnut with the rest of us. The trinity of spongy pastry, decadent chocolate ganache,
         and velvety custard could easily be the answer to the question, “If you could only eat one type of doughnut for the rest of your life what would it be?”

        Some bakeries take shortcuts, like using regular chocolate frosting or piping in Bavarian or whipped cream, but the fact that even those half-hearted 
        ones taste divine is a testament to this doughnut’s greatness.</p>
