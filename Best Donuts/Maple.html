    <h1>Maple Bacon Bar</h1>
    <p>It’s hard to say at what point this became a staple, but suffice to say it’s become de rigueur for doughnut shops to offer something that features smoky,
         salty bacon and sweet maple syrup. Most often it’s found as a longjohn, which can showcase the strips of bacon lengthwise. Not only does it playfully
          interact with the mythical sweet, salty, and umami sections of your tongue, it’s packed with protein so you can trick yourself into thinking 
          it’s part of a nutritious, balanced breakfast.
